## üí™ Some quotes/advice I find useful
> As a man you need to realize that you are responsible to everything good and bad that happens to you.

> If you chase happiness, sadness will chase you. If you chase your goals, happiness will chase you.

> When faced upon a problem, a true man does not complain, he fixes it.

> A car can only see the road, but not the land around it. A plane can only see the land below it, but cannot perceive the details that the car can perceive. A helicopter can do both. Your mind needs to be like the helicopter.

> Do the most important thing of the day, before doing anything else and before it becomes important AND urgent.

> I do not allow negative thoughts enter my mind. - Bruce Lee.
